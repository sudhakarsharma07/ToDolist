Todo-List Application
This repository contains a simple To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to add, display, and delete tasks, with all data stored in the browser's localStorage to ensure tasks persist even after a page refresh.
Features  :
Add tasks: Users can input tasks and add them to their list.
Display tasks: The application dynamically displays the list of tasks, and the number of pending tasks is updated.
Delete tasks: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
Reset list: All tasks can be cleared at once with the "Reset" button.
Local Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage so they remain even after a page refresh
